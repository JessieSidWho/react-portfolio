## Description

This was the third project that we created for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

The pupose of this project was to set up a web space where people can listen to music, chat with their peers, and concentrate on their work.

## Features

### Music

This application uses several pre-recorded videos of five different music genres.

 - Lofi
 - Reggae
 - Indie
 - Jazz
 - Coffee
 - Metal

### Chat

There is a chat feature. Any messages sent will be displayed to any other users who are in the chat. Chat messages are saved to our database and will persist even after logging out of the application. The number of people connected to Study-Live are displayed at the top of the chat box.

In order to be properly identified in the chat, you will need to log in to your google account.

Don't have one? Then go make one! It's easy enough, just go to [google.com](https://www.google.com) and sign up.

If you don't want to sign up for a google account, you can experience the website by clicking this [link](https://study-live.herokuapp.com/main).
